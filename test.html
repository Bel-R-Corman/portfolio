    <h2>  Python Shapes</h2>
    <p>Today I made a house out of shapes. I made a triangle first by using the following code:
      Then I made a square under it using the following code:
      It was fun but mildly stressful because my consol would keep on closing randomly whenever I wanted to minimize the screen</p>

    <h3>  Text Adventure</h3>
    <p>Today I made a pirate text adventure. The gist of the program was that everytime you clicked a button you continued through the story and as the program presented you with a bunch of choices imput your choice.
      My main character was a pirate who sailed the seas to find a treasure. Along the way he encountered a sword fight and a cave or a sea 
      monster. It was really fun to write the story, being creative with the language and all! (Especially since its pirates!!)</p>

    <h4>  Color Changer</h4>
    <p>Today I changed the color pixels of a Sherlock picture. The picture was origonally a normal color and then I shifted it to a red, 
       light blue, dark blue and yellow scheme. I did this using a list of the pixels from the origonal color scheme and then if the pixels 
       were between a certian number the color would change.</p>
    <p>In the begining I didnt really understand how the proccess worked so that was a little challenging and remebering the litle colons
       and which parenthases to use is really annoying.I also started working on user imput 
       to pick which picure the user wanted to change. Unfortunatly, I didnt finish. Another challenge was that in the beggining my picture 
       kept on warpping for some reason, I never figured out why...</p>
    <p> It was really rewarding to come out with the final product.</p>

    <h5> LED Lights</h5>
    <p>It was REALLY REALLY REALLY FRUSTRATING!!!!! I liked the traffic light part because it was rewarding when it actually worked but 
      the Photocell activity only worked in the last five minutes.</p>
